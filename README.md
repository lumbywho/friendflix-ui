## <a id="purpose"></a>Purpose of this project 🎯
Makes it easy to find out which movies both you and your friends would like to watch.

User Goals:
- Maintain a list of movies (that the user would like to watch)
- Maintain a list of friends (and see their lists of movies)
- See a list of common movies (that are in both the user's list and a particular friend's list)

## <a id="installation-steps"></a>Installation steps 📋

#### To do this the easy way, go see the live version at: [https://friendflix.netlify.app/](https://friendflix.netlify.app/)

However, if the online version doesn't work — or if you'd prefer to run it locally — please follow the following instructions to run this project locally on your machine:

### pre-requisites:
- Make sure that NodeJS is installed.
	- [Installation instructions](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/#how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm)
- Make sure that ports ``3000`` and ``5000`` are available.

---
**Note**: If one of the ports is not available...
- If port ``3000`` is not available, the application will run on the next available port.
	- If it doesn't show up on http://localhost:3000/ — scroll up (in the terminal) after running the project to find out which next available port it is running on.
- If port ``5000`` is not available:
	-  open  ``/package.json`` in the code editor of your choice and change the port number ``5000`` in the "backend" script variable to your desired port:
		- "backend": "json-server --watch db.json --port ``5000``"
		- For example if you wanted to set it to port 4242, this would become:
		  "backend": "json-server --watch db.json --port ``4242``"
	- open ``/.env`` file and set the API_PORT variable to your desired port:
		- API_URL: "``http://localhost:5000/``"
		- So if you wanted to set it to port 4242, this would become:
		  API_URL: "``http://localhost:4242/``"
---

### how to run
1. navigate to project's root directory
2. run the command  ``npm install``
3. run the command ``npm run start``
4. see the project live at http://localhost:3000/ (or at the next available port, if port 3000 is not available)

### project folder structure after compile/build
same as before, with the following two folders added within the root directory:
- ``.nuxt/`` 
- ``node_modules/`` 


## <a id="list-of-tools"></a>List of tools used as part of creating the project 🛠️
Front-end:
- HTML, CSS (with Tailwind)
- VueJS (with NuxtJS)

API:
- JSON Server (a full fake REST API to fill in as the back-end)

Code editor:
- Visual Studio Code

Package manager:
- npm


## <a id="generated-by-tools"></a>List of parts of the project generated by tools 🏭
- The API (by JSON Server)
- Boilerplate for some of the config files in root directory 


## <a id="coded-by-me"></a>List of parts of the code I wrote ✍🏼
- Configured config files in root directory
- Wrote code for everything in the ``/src`` folder

These are the most relevant files pertaining to this project's code (the rest is mostly boilerplate/setup stuff):
- ``/src/``
	- ``app.vue``
	- ``components/``
		- ``MovieCard.vue``
		- ``PersonCard.vue``
		- ``TheNavbar.vue``

## <a id="design-guidelines"></a>Design Guidelines Applied ✔️

#### Chapter 2: Our Vision is Optimized to See Structure
- **Proximity**: Objects near each other (relative to other objects) appear grouped, while those further apart do not.
	- For example — the proximity between the movie information elements on all the movie cards.
- **Similarity**: Objects that look similar appear grouped.
	- For example — the movie list cards or user list cards.
- **Continuity**: Our visual perception is biased to perceive continuous forms rather than disconnected segments.
	- For example — the "Common Matches" / "Their List" button on a friend's page.
- **Symmetry**: Our visual system parses complex scenes in a way that reduces their complexity by recognizing symmetries.
	- I have followed a symmetrical layout for the UI components throughout this application.
- **Figure/Ground**: Our mind separates the visual field into the figure (the foreground) and the ground (background).
	- This principle can be seen in action throughout this application.
	- For example — the "Common Matches" / "Their List" button on a friend's page.
- **Common Fate**: Objects that move together are perceived as grouped or related.
	- For example — the "Common Matches" / "Their List" button on a friend's page.

### Chapter 3: We Seek and Use Visual Structure
- Hierarchical structuring of information, using section headings and labels that screen readers can recognize as headings, helps people with visual impairments find their desired content.
	- I used the property 'aria-current' while making the navbar, which should let screenreaders detect which main page button is active right now (if any).

#### Chapter 4: Our Color Vision is Limited
- Use distinctive colors. ✅
- Separate strong opponent colors. ✅
- Avoid color pairs that color-blind people cannot distinguish. ✅
	- The only time 2 buttons appear together — their colors are green and white — which color-blind people can distinguish between easily!
- Use color redundantly with other cues. ✅

#### Chapter 6: Reading is Unnatural
- Users can easily understand and scan through all the text.
- Minimal text, graphics are used instead of text whenever possible.

#### Chapter 8: Limits on Attention Shape Our Though and Action
- Designed in a way such that users can focus on their goals and the application fades into the background.

#### Chapter 9: Recognition is Easy; Recall is Hard
- Recognition versus recall
	- See and choose: users can perceive their options (rather than recalling them)
	- Pictures (icons) used wherever possible to convey functions
		- For example, the icons accompanying every single button!
	- Thumbnail images used on movie lists to depict full-size images compactly, which let users see more of their data at once while being enough to spark recoginition.

#### Chapter 10: Learning from Experience and Performed Actions are Easy; Novel Actions, Problem-Solving, and Calculation are Hard
- Number and complexity of settings is kept to a minimum.
- Users are allowed to use perception rather than calculation.
- Designed for familiarity: the UI is not designed keeping uniqueness in mind - it is similar to how many popular applications look so that users can get used to it easily.
- Consistent design and functionality.

#### Chapter 11: Many Factors Affect Learning
- Progressive disclosure: advanced functionality is hidden until users need it.
	- For example — to view a movie's trailer or remove it from your list — you have to actually click on it and reach the movie page first.

#### Chapter 13: Human Decision-Making is Rarely Rational
- Big click-targets (big buttons)

#### Chapter 14: We Have Time Requirements
- Highly responsive (user actions - as well as data operations and rendering - are executed practically instantly)!

#### Chapter 15: We Make Errors
- Easy to recover from mistakes or slips
	- For example — if you click the 'Remove Movie' button — it is immediately replaced by the 'Add Movie' button! And even if you navigated to another page, you could always click the 'back button' and add that movie back to your list!
